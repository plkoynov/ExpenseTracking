### Who I am and what problem I have

I run a small-to-medium company where employees regularly spend money on behalf of the company — travel, meals, office supplies, software subscriptions, and similar expenses.

Right now, expense handling is **painful and inefficient**:

- People send receipts via email or chat
- Some use spreadsheets, some don’t
- Approvals are unclear and slow
- It’s hard to know what’s pending, approved, or already reimbursed
- We often lose context (why something was rejected, who approved it, when)

This causes:

- Frustration for employees
- Extra work for managers
- Errors and delays in reimbursements
- No clear audit trail

I want a **simple internal system** that helps us manage this process clearly and consistently.

---

### What I want the system to help me achieve

I want:

- Employees to **submit expenses in a structured way**
- Managers to **review and decide quickly**
- Everyone to always know the **current status** of an expense
- Clear rules so there is no confusion or arguing later
- A history of decisions (who approved or rejected, and why)

This system does **not** need to be fancy or complex.
It just needs to be **reliable, clear, and predictable**.

---

### How I imagine people using the system (High-Level)

#### Submitting expenses (Employee perspective)

- Employees record work-related expenses with basic information
- Expenses can be saved temporarily before submission
- Employees can fix mistakes or remove drafts before submitting
- Once submitted, expenses should not change automatically or accidentally

---

#### Reviewing expenses (Manager perspective)

- Managers see a clear list of expenses waiting for review
- Each expense includes enough context to make a decision
- Managers approve or reject expenses and explain their decision
- The system prevents invalid or duplicate actions

---

### Transparency and trust

For both employees and managers:

- It must always be clear what the current status of an expense is
- Decisions should show who made them, when, and why
- Rejected expenses should clearly explain what needs to be fixed
- Approved expenses should be final and protected from changes

---

### What I explicitly do NOT want

- Complex accounting features
- Bank or payment integrations
- Advanced reporting or analytics
- Mobile applications
- Overly flexible rules that cause inconsistent behavior

This is an **internal operational tool**, not a customer-facing product.

---

### What matters most to me

If I had to summarize, the system must be:

1. **Clear** – no ambiguity about what can be done and when
2. **Structured** – the same process for everyone
3. **Traceable** – decisions and comments are visible later
4. **Simple** – minimal features, minimal learning curve

If it achieves these things, it solves my problem.
